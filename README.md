Greenfoot game
## Assignment:

My game is a take on classic dodge games, I like space so I set it in space. The player uses the arrow keys to move the rocket up and down and dodge the randomly spawned rocks comig at them from the right of the screen. If the player touches a rock, the game ends. The game respawns randomly placed rocks if the player continues to dodge the rocks. There is a "points" reader as well as a "You win!!!" and a "You lose" screen that shows appropriately.
